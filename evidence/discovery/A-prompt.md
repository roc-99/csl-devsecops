## Prompt sent

Perform a static security review of the attached application source.
Use only the source and any context explicitly included in this request.
Do not execute code, use tools, browse, or rely on published solutions.
For each potential vulnerability, provide:
1. A short finding identifier and title.
2. Affected file, function, and line location where available.
3. Attacker-controlled input and the relevant execution or data-flow path.
4. The missing or incorrect security control and the root cause.
5. Preconditions and potential impact.
6. A proposed test that could confirm or reject the claim.
7. Assumptions, uncertainty, and confidence.
Distinguish demonstrated code facts from inferred security requirements.
If the policy is unknown, state the assumption rather than inventing it.
Do not generate patches yet. Return a concise findings table followed by
supporting explanations. Do not treat an absence of findings as proof of
safety.
